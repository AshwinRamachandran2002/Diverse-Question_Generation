        "I bought this cooling rack, along with a Nordic Ware 13x18 half sheet, and the two make an excellent combination. Both should last for several years. I do think the rack is slightly overpriced (hence the four-star rating rather than five), but is still a good value. I received the weekly e-mail the other day from America's Test Kitchen and I think this was their top-rated cooling rack (I think I'm right about that; I'd have to look it up to be sure).",
        "I'm happy enough with my purchase of this rack I'm buying a second. It fits nearly perfectly in the Nordic Ware Baker's Half Sheet 13x18 (available on Amazon). The metal seems to be of decent quality, and the welds are solid enough.",
        "I bought this to fit the Nordic Ware half sheet pan. It's a perfect fit! I use it to cook bacon in the oven -- no muss, no fuss, and very crispy bacon.",
        "The CIA half-sheet size wire rack is a well made product I have used it several times to roast chicken wings (Alton Brown style), washed it n the dishwasher and no signs of corrosion or bad craftsmanship. The only grip I have (and the reason I didn't give it 5 of 5 stars) is that it is too large by about a 1/4\" length and width for my Nordic Ware half sheet pan, which I purchased at the same time assuming that a half-sheet rack would fit a half-sheet pan.",
        "I bought this rack to use in the oven with my Nordic Ware 1/2 sheet pan and Wear-Ever 1/2 size sheet pan (model #5314). The fit is a little tight with the Nordic Ware pan, but overall it works well with both! We love making bacon in the oven, so I see this rack getting a lot of action. My only complaint, which is not really a fault with this product and how well it functions, but feel obligated to mention nonetheless, is that the bacon grease cleanup can be a bit tedious with the small grid pattern.",
        "I use this in my new Nordic Ware baking pan (same size - \"half\" sheet...which is big).....to roast veggies mostly. I prefer veggies roasted as opposed to any other method because of the flavor & texture. THIS rack allows me to roast or bake anything without having to flip the food ... or the food getting soggy. You food gets crisp on all sides. Then I pull the pan (w/this rack) out of the oven & let my veggies cool a minute & nothing gets soggy.",
        "These are great. Fit very nicely with my nordic ware natural aluminum commercial baker's half sheet. And work great as cooling racks. Kale and cookies - what more could you ask for. Zero rust so far.",
        "Purchased this to use in my Nordic Ware 43100 bakers half sheet to cook bacon. My big concern was fit and as it turns out it fits perfectly! It's well made with no sharp edges or pokey bits.",
        "This CIA rack fits the Nordic Ware Bakers Half Sheet perfectly. I've used this rack for cooling cookies and cakes, for baking chicken, turkey sausage, and turkey bacon. I hestitated buying this rack; because of all the grids, I thought cleaning it would be a nightmare. I was pleasantly surprised to find that food doesn't stick to this rack and cleanup is actually a  breeze. I put it in hot soapy water, wipe with a sponge, rinse it with the spray nozzle...done in a matter of seconds.",
        "Nordic Ware Bakers Half Sheet, 13 by 18 by 1 InchThe airflow under the rack really makes a difference when grilling. Get this drip pan as well and you wont be sorry! Its also great for wings!"

        "This rack is a bit expensive ($16) but it has 6 feet as opposed to the standard 4 so if you're cooling cookies it's a bit overkill but if you're cooking a roast then it's recommended, it cleans easily and fits perfectly in the half sheet baking pans I reviewed, with this combination you can put water in the pan for roasting that juicy bird or cow."

I was answered THE NEXT DAY!!\"The CIA Cooling Rack can be used in the oven as a drip rack.  We suggest no higher temp than 450 degrees be used. Do not use under broiler.\"Hope this is helpful."

            "answerText": "YES!!!   I purchased both and I was a bit concerned that it wouldn't fit.  The first time I used them they were a little tight.  The steel rack and aluminum pan must expand and contract with heat at different rates because they now fit perfectly.....like they were made for each other.  I'm so pleased I purchased them both.  They're used for making bacon in the oven at least once a week.  I line the Nordic Ware pan with heavy duty foil and then insert the CIA rack.  Couldn't ask for a better fit.  By the way, the rack cleans up perfectly in the dishwasher.  I don't but the pan in the dishwasher because aluminum can stain from the dishwasher chemicals.",
