        "A lot of reviewers have said things about this puzzle not being that durable, but we've had ours over a year now and it hasn't lost even a speck of paint or chipped any wood at all. My kids love it. The puzzle pieces are durable and sturdy. My kids march the dinosaurs around and pretend games with them as well as just doing the puzzle. I am glad I bought this for them.",
        "It's intentionally deceptive marketing, but does any of that really matter in the practical sense?I think it does.Medium density fiberboard (MDF) is nasty stuff. Containing a higher resin-to-wood ration than any other pressed wood product, MDF emits VOCs for at least a few months after manufacture and emits urea formaldehyde for the duration of its life.",
        "As the paint wears away, it becomes apparent that these puzzle pieces are nothing but pressed paper-like sawdust material. When revealed beneath the chipped-off paint, this dry, dusty substance easily flakes off where it can get into little mouths and become part of the general household dust.Okay, so Melissa and Doug fudged a little on their description, which was prominently displayed on the packaging for our puzzle.",
        "Also, since the side and back is not painted on each piece, the MDF is a little rough and scratchy for little hands and it blends in with the carpet, they are constantly being stepped on when they end up on the floor. The farm animals puzzle pieces were individually painted however, and this made up for the MDF on these.",
        "I have to say I'm very disappointed with the quality of this puzzle and in Melissa & Doug for allowing their products to be produced this way. They have been known for the quality of their wooden toys but it seems that quantity now matters more. I gave it 3 stars only because my twins seem to like playing with them.I purchased this puzzle along with the \"farm animals\" one and they are both made from MDF, but as others have said the pieces on this one were not individually painted.",
        "very sturdy wood pieces. my son loves the bright colors. well built, not like some of the cardboard ones out there. will definately order another one",
        "My 22 month old son loves this puzzle. The pieces are easy for him to pick up and he has learned to \"adjust\" each piece so it fits into its correct slot.",
        "as others have pointed out, the pieces aren't \"wood\" in any sense that the average buyer would agree. they're not cut out of solid pieces of dried tree. and when they start to go - or when a dog gets ahold of one, or a child with a particularly tenacious chewing habit, they disintegrate in minutes.I am sorely disappointed in the company - misleading labeling guarantees I won't be a repeat buyer.",
        "I was very dissapointed in this puzzle!! The quality is NOT \"good\" as in the description, but very POOR!! My one year old son received it yesterday as a birthday gift and my inital excitement over this very colorful and pretty seeming puzzle turned into mere dissapointment: in a matter of only 5 minutes a piece of the ply wood (the puzzle is made of) came off one of the pieces! My son could have swallowed it, if I would have not noticed.",
        "This is from all external appearances a great little puzzle. It's certainly a great concept for a 'first' puzzle, with it's bright fun aesthetically-appealing dinosaurs and easy-match puzzle board. It is certainly educational, and when I bought it I felt pretty good about my kids playing with it.We own the older style - painted 'wooden' pieces. When I think wooden, I think solid wood, which is what these pieces appear to be."

            "answerText": "Yes they seem to be made of MDF and it is a fact that the paint chips off on the edges where they impact when repeatedly thrown or dropped, not too unrealistic a reality.  I think from a green recycling perspective I'de rather they we made of MDF than solid wood, it saves allot of trees this way, and these amazing puzzles are not very expensive.  I am pleased with mine, Oh' and so is Baby! lol",

I would think with such heavy use those pieces would show significant wear. That after a year or more, the library's pieces are in good condition testifies to the high quality of Melissa & Doug products.",
